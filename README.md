Using automobile fuel consumption and emissions data for the last 14 years provided by the Federal Government of Canada we set out to create a service that allows the visitor to view and compare passenger automobile data to see their environmental and financial impacts.

This application was developed with the intention of raising awareness about the impact of our automobile usage on Canadians' environment, finances, and productivity.

We hoped to achieve these goals by providing a tool that gave vistors the ability to:

Compare fuel consumption and CO2 emissions between vehicle models
Calculate the cost of travel using fuel consumption rates and current average gas rates accross Canada
Use historical data to graph and show increasing environmental standards for automobiles
Outline tangible real-world impacts of oil production based on the visitor's usage
In addition, we have created a public web service around the imported data to allow others to easily integrate the data into their own applications.
